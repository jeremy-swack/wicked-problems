## DeepQB - Using Deep Neural Networks to Understand the NFL Passing Game
In 2018, the National Football League (NFL) made its introduction to the world of big data, joining its fellow leagues in Major League Baseball (MLB) and the National Basketball Association (NBA). In February of that year, the NFL announced they were releasing player tracking data from the 2016 and 2017 seasons. Collected through small sensors inserted into players’ shoulder pads, this newly released data gave the public access to the individual locations of all 22 players on the field at all times. This more sophisticated data allowed for the creation of more intricate models, such as renowned NFL analyst Brian Burke’s DeepQB model.

Unlike the rigid plate appearances of a sport like baseball, the fluidity and complexity of football creates a unique challenge for creating advanced statistics and models. In particular, the interdependence between a quarterback and his receivers can make it difficult to separate whether a QB made a good decision on a play or if they were bailed out by a good receiver. Burke’s DeepQB model and its use of tracking data allows for a better understanding of quarterback decision making. The model was trained using player tracking data from the 2016 and 2017 seasons. Certain variables in the model include receiver position, speed and acceleration, the position of the two nearest defenders, shoulder orientation of players except the quarterback (to prevent bias), down, distance, yard line, and whether the quarterback was under stress. The model was then broken into 4 variants: one for target probability, one for expected yards per attempt, one for pass outcomes, and a final experimental variant to analyze individual quarterback performance. Each variant provides its own unique information about quarterback decision making.

Burke uses a feedforwarding artificial neural network (FFN) to create the 4 variants. In this type of neural network, information does not loop through different nodes. Rather, it goes straight through from the input nodes through the hidden layers to the output nodes. In the DeepQB model, there are 230 input nodes, 2 hidden layers consisting of 256 and 128 nodes respectively, and lastly 5, 1, or 3 output nodes, depending on which variant of the model is being used. Variants 1 and 4 use 5 output nodes, Variant 2 uses 1, and Variant 3 uses 3.

All four of DeepQB’s variants yield interesting and promising results. In Variant 1, the model predicted the intended receiver of the play nearly 60% of the time. Considering there are usually 5 available targets for a quarterback on any given play, this means the model is effectively understanding which receiver the quarterback should throw the ball to. If a quarterback is consistently targeting receivers the model gives low probabilities, it likely means that the quarterback is making suboptimal choices when it comes to decisions in the passing game. Variant 2 has the power to make assertions about the effectiveness of quarterbacks. By calculating what the yards per attempt (YPA) of the play should be, the model can assess which quarterbacks are being too cautious or too aggressive. Variant 3 uncovers misconceptions about completion percentage in football. Because the model can determine how difficult a play is for a quarterback, it can more accurately determine the chance a particular play will end in an interception. Lastly, Variant 4 looks individually at each quarterback over the 2 years of data and sees how closely they line up with the model’s decision making. Unfortunately, because the model is only working off 2 years of data, each quarterback does not have enough attempts for the model to be accurate. However, a catch all metric that could grade quarterback decision making would be a huge asset for all NFL front offices, so this variant is certainly intriguing.

The era of tracking data analysis in the NFL is still quite new. It is likely as more years of data are released, more complex, and more accurate models are released. However, Brian Burke’s DeepQB gives a very interesting look into the future of tracking data models in the NFL.
